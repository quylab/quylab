Hi Quy,

Here are some quick specifications to make a piece of planogram software for your software portfolio.

Planogram Software

A planogram is a diagram to communicate to staff how to stack the shelves. This is pre-arranged in order to allow the best positioning of items according to factors such as: amount of stock, height and width of packaging, locating complementary items nearby, locating items of the same brands near each other, etc.

The task is to create a simplified version of planogram layout software featuring the following features:

 - A set number of 'carrels' (full height shelving units normally about 1.2m wide, 2m high - the bigger shops now use 2m+ wide ones. Recommend using 3 or 4 of the 1.2m wide ones.)
 - A set number of shelves at specific heights in the carrels
 - Ability to load in items by specifying the height and width of an item
 - Ability to specify from a set of placeholder images or upload an image for each item, defaulting to a brand image if one is not set
 - Ability to arrange the items, either using drag and drop, or select box for carrel, row and position for each item. If using select box for position, have the options 0 to n, the number of items, with 0 meaning to insert to beginning of row, and n meaning to insert a the end. Each carrel and row should also have a position.
 - Indicate when a row has been allocated items that are overdimensioned - either too high, or too wide so that items will not fit
 - Remember to allow an item to be placed in multiple places (such as side by side)
 - Have the shelves half filled to use as demo
 - Persist a different copy for each user to the database, identifying users with a randomly generated cookie.
 
Bonus tasks:
 - Allow heights and positions of shelves to be changed
 - Use drag and drop to place items
 - Allow adding and rearranging carrels, rearranging rows
 - Allow naming each item, and searching for them when entering planograms
